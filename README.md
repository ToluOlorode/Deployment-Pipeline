# Jenkins Pipeline Project with Maven, SonarQube, Nexus, and Tomcat Integration

This repository contains a Jenkins pipeline project that automates the build, test, and deployment process for a Java application using Maven, SonarQube for code analysis, Nexus for artifact storage, and Tomcat for deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up this pipeline, ensure you have the following components and tools installed and configured:

1. **Jenkins**: Install and set up Jenkins on your server. You can follow the official documentation [here](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/).

2. **Maven**: Ensure Maven is installed on the Jenkins server. You can download it from the [official website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and follow the installation instructions.

3. **SonarQube**: Set up a SonarQube server for code analysis. Follow the official documentation [here](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/setup/get-started-2-minutes/).

4. **Nexus**: Configure Nexus as your artifact repository manager. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/installation).

5. **Tomcat**: Prepare a Tomcat server for deploying your Java application. Installation instructions can be found on the [Tomcat website](http://tomcat.apache.org/).

## Jenkins Pipeline Configuration

1. Fork or clone this repository to your local machine or Jenkins server.

2. Create a new Jenkins pipeline job:
   - Open Jenkins and select "New Item."
   - Choose "Pipeline" as the job type and give it a name.

3. In the pipeline configuration:
   - Under the "Pipeline" section, select "Pipeline script from SCM" as the Definition.
   - Choose your version control system (e.g., Git) and provide the repository URL.
   - Specify the branch (e.g., `main` or `master`) and the path to the `Jenkinsfile` in the repository.

4. Save the job configuration.

## Jenkinsfile

The `Jenkinsfile` in this repository defines the stages of the pipeline:

1. **Clone**: This stage checks out the source code from your Git repository.

2. **Build and Test (Maven)**: This stage builds the Java application using Maven and runs tests.

3. **SonarQube Analysis**: This stage analyzes the code using SonarQube. Make sure to configure SonarQube server credentials in Jenkins.

4. **Publish to Nexus**: This stage publishes the build artifacts to Nexus. Configure Nexus credentials in Jenkins.

5. **Deploy to Tomcat**: This stage deploys the application to Tomcat. Make sure to configure Tomcat credentials and server details in Jenkins.

## Running the Pipeline

- Trigger the pipeline manually or set up a webhook or schedule to run it automatically when code changes are pushed to the repository.

- The pipeline will execute each stage sequentially and report the status of each step in the Jenkins job console.

## Conclusion

This Jenkins pipeline project automates the entire process of building, testing, analyzing, and deploying a Java application. You can further customize the `Jenkinsfile` and pipeline stages to fit your specific project requirements.

Feel free to explore and adapt this setup to your needs, and don't forget to secure your credentials and secrets in Jenkins for a production environment.
