# Simple Jenkins Pipeline Project

This repository contains a basic Jenkins pipeline project that demonstrates how to automate the building and testing of a sample application. The pipeline is defined using a Jenkinsfile and includes stages for building, testing, and deploying the application using GIT, Maven, Sonarqube, Nexus and Tomcat.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up and running this Jenkins pipeline project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Jenkins Server**: You need access to a Jenkins server. If you don't have one set up yet, you can follow the official [Jenkins Installation Guide](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/) to get started.

2. **Git**: Make sure Git is installed on your system as this project assumes you'll be using Git to clone the repository and interact with Jenkins.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Jenkins pipeline:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/toluolorode/Deployment-Pipeline.git
   cd Deployment-Pipeline
   ```

2. **Jenkins Configuration**:
   - Log in to your Jenkins server.
   - Install necessary plugins, including the Pipeline plugin.
   - Set up Jenkins credentials if required (e.g., for Git authentication or deployment).

3. **Create a New Pipeline in Jenkins**:

   - In Jenkins, click on "New Item" to create a new pipeline project.
   - Choose "Pipeline" as the project type.
   - Configure your pipeline:
     - Under "Pipeline," select "Pipeline script from SCM" as the Definition.
     - Choose Git as the SCM and provide the repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/ToluOlorode/Deployment-Pipeline.git`).
     - Specify the branch to build (e.g., `main`).
     - Save your pipeline configuration.

4. **Run the Pipeline**:

   - Trigger the pipeline manually by clicking "Build Now" or configure a webhook or polling strategy to automatically trigger builds on code changes.

## Jenkins Pipeline Overview

The Jenkins pipeline defined in this project consists of the following stages:

1. **Clone**: This stage checks out the source code from the Git repository.

2. **Test**: This stage runs tests on the built application. You can adapt this stage to run your specific test suite.

3. **Build**: In this stage, we build the sample application. You can modify the build commands in the Jenkinsfile to match your project's build process.

5. **Deploy**: If needed, you can add a deploy stage to deploy the application to a production environment. Customize this stage according to your deployment requirements.

## Customizing the Pipeline

You can customize the Jenkins pipeline to suit your specific project needs. Edit the Jenkinsfile to modify the stages, add additional steps, or integrate other tools and services as required.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the pipeline, refer to Jenkins logs and error messages for troubleshooting. Make sure your Jenkins server is properly configured and has the necessary plugins and credentials.
